    "You are a data professional in a data analytics firm called Automatidata. Their client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), was impressed with the work you have done and has requested that you **build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will not leave a tip**. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip, since drivers depend on tips, and the ability to filter out people who don't tip would help increase driver revenue.

    "#### **Step 4: Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  \n",
    "_This is not a great model, but depending on how it's used it could still be useful. If the objective is only to help give taxi drivers a better idea of whether someone will leave a good tip, then it could be useful. It may be worthwhile to test it with a select group of taxi drivers to get feedback._\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your highest scoring model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",
    "_Unfortunately, XGBoost is not the most transparent machine learning algorithm. We know that `duration`, `trip_distance`, and `fare_amount` are the most important features, but we don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration._\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**   \n",
    "_There are almost always additional features that can be engineered, but hopefully the most obvious ones were generated during the first round of modeling. In our case, we could try creating three new columns that indicate if the trip distance is short, medium, or far. We could also engineer a column that gives a ratio that represents (the amount of money from the fare amount to the nearest higher multiple of $5) / fare amount. For example, if the fare were \\\\$12, the value in this column would be 0.25, because \\\\$12 to the nearest higher multiple of \\\\$5 (\\\\$15) is \\\\$3, and \\\\$3 divided by \\\\$12 is 0.25. The intuition for this feature is that people might be likely to simply round up their tip, so journeys with fares with values just under a multiple of \\\\$5 may have lower tip percentages than those with fare values just over a multiple of \\\\$5. We could also do the same thing for fares to the nearest \\\\$10._\n",
    "<br/>  \n",
    "$\\text{{round5\\_ratio}} = \\frac{{\\text{{amount of money from the fare amount to the nearest higher multiple of \\$5}}}}{{\\text{{fare amount}}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>  \n",
    "\n",
    "  <details>\n",
    "    <summary><h5>HINT</h5></summary>\n",
    "  $$ = \\frac{5 - (fare\\ mod\\ 5)}{fare\\ amount}$$  \n",
    "  </details>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?**   \n",
    "_It would probably be very helpful to have past tipping behavior for each customer. It would also be valuable to have accurate tip values for customers who pay with cash._\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? What insights can you report back to stakeholders? "
