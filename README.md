# Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate Projects
The following is a collection of projects that were completed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. These projects were undertaken to demonstrate proficiency in various data skills and helped to provide practical experience in the data field.

## Projects Overview
The Goolge Advanced Data Analytics Certificate consisted of 7 courses that covered essential topics including data inspection, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, regression modeling, and machine learning. Each course culminated in an end of course project which provided an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the subject matter. The final course included a capstone project which can be viewed in a dedicated project repository [`insert name here`]

## Notebooks
This repository includes five Jupyter notebooks which each focus on a specific stage of the data project lifecycle:

**02_data_inspection.ipynb:** This notebook encompasses the initial data inspection and preprocessing steps. It covers tasks such as data loading, cleaning, handling missing values, and data transformation.

**03_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb:** In this notebook, exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to gain insights into the dataset. It includes visualisations, summary statistics, correlation analysis, and other techniques to understand the relationships between variables.

**04_statistical_analysis.ipynb:** The third notebook focuses on statistical analysis of the dataset. It includes hypothesis testing, statistical inference, and other statistical techniques to examine the significance of variables and identify patterns or trends.

**05_regression_modelling.ipynb:** This notebook explores regression modeling techniques to predict taxi gratuities. It covers various regression algorithms, model selection, feature engineering, model evaluation, and interpretation.

**06_machine_learning.ipynb:** The final notebook explores advanced machine learning techniques for taxi gratuity prediction. It focuses on the application of two powerful algorithms: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. The notebook covers the entire machine learning pipeline, including model training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and the selection of the best-performing model. By leveraging these techniques, accurate predictions of taxi gratuity can be made with high precision and reliability.

## Conclusion
This portfolio of projects demonstrates proficiency and expertise in a wide range of data analysis techniques which were acquired through the completion of the certificate program. 

These projects illustrate the ability to effectively apply data inspection, exploratory analysis, statistical analysis, regression modeling, and machine learning to real-world datasets. The showcased skills allow meaningful insights, accurate predictions, and valuable recommendations to be derived from data analysis. 

By combining theoretical knowledge with practical application, this portfolio demonstrates the capability to tackle complex data challenges and deliver impactful results.
