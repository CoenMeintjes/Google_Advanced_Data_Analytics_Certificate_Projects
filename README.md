# Predicting Taxi Gratuities in NYC Portfolio Project
This portfolio project, titled "Predicting Taxi Gratuities in NYC," was completed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate program. The project aimed to develop a predictive model for estimating taxi gratuities in New York City based on various features and variables.

## Project Overview
The project consisted of several stages, including data inspection, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, regression modeling, and machine learning. Each stage was documented and implemented using Jupyter notebooks. The project proposal document provided an overview of the project goals, methodology, and expected outcomes.

## Notebooks
The project includes five Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a specific stage of the process:

**01_data_inspection.ipynb:** This notebook contains the initial data inspection and preprocessing steps. It includes tasks such as data loading, data cleaning, handling missing values, and data transformation.

**02_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb:** In this notebook, exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to gain insights into the dataset. It includes visualizations, summary statistics, correlation analysis, and other techniques to understand the relationships between variables.

**03_statistical_analysis.ipynb:** The third notebook focuses on statistical analysis of the dataset. It includes hypothesis testing, statistical inference, and other statistical techniques to examine the significance of variables and identify patterns or trends.

**04_regression_modelling.ipynb:** This notebook explores regression modeling techniques to predict taxi gratuities. It covers various regression algorithms, model selection, feature engineering, model evaluation, and interpretation.

**05_machine_learning.ipynb:** The final notebook delves into machine learning techniques for taxi gratuity prediction. It includes the application of machine learning algorithms, model training and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and the selection of the best-performing model.

## Conclusion
The "Predicting Taxi Gratuities in NYC" portfolio project undertaken as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate program aimed to develop a predictive model for estimating taxi gratuities in New York City. The project involved thorough data inspection, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, regression modeling, and machine learning techniques. The accompanying notebooks and project proposal document provide detailed insights into each stage of the project and the methodologies employed.
